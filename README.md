### About Bellabeat:
Bellabeat is a successful high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women with the potential to become a large player in the smart devices industry. Founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, their goal is to "develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world" through their different styled devices that track activity, sleep and stress:

- **Leaf** -> a wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip.
- **Time** -> a wellness watch that combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart tracking technology.
- **Spring** -> a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day.

All of them come together in Bellabeat's *app*, that provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits to help them better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions.

### Business Task Summary:

Sršen is conscious of the power of data-driven business decisions to help Bellabeat grow, so she's asked the marketing analysts team to analyse smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The findings will be shared to Bellabeat's key stakeholders (i.e. Sršen, Mur and Marketing team) in order to provide recommendations on how to apply marketing strategies to their own products based on the results derived.
The task will be achieved following Google's Data Analysis Professional Certificate journey of **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyse**, **Share** and **Act** phases.
